# nachocanvas
The world's first Android app backed by the full strength of nacho cheese corn chips. It was built in Android Studio. 

Notes on GitHub integration. I tried to follow the tutorial at http://www.londonappdeveloper.com/how-to-use-git-hub-with-android-studio/. I was disobedient. Something like this worked:
  1) Create the project in AS
  2) In GitHub desktop, create a new repository at the root of this project
  3) Publish the repository.
  
The next time I try, I will record the steps more carefully.
